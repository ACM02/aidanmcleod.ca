# aidanmcleod.ca

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I made this site so I can showcase my projects, technical skills, and interests, as well as exercise my creativity and learn more about web hosting.

You can view the site live here: [aidanmcleod.ca](https://aidanmcleod.ca)

## Tech Stack

The site is build using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) styling to keep it simple and easy for me to work on.

## Development

To work on the website, you'll need Node.js and npm installed ([guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)), then you can clone and run it.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ACM02/aidan-mcleod.ca.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd aidan-mcleod.ca

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
